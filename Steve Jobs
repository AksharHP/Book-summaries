Steve Jobs (1955–2011) was a visionary entrepreneur and design perfectionist who revolutionized the personal computing, animated movie, music, phone, and tablet publishing industries. Born in San Francisco and adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, he grew up in Silicon Valley, developing an early interest in electronics.

After dropping out of Reed College and traveling through India, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer in 1976 with Steve Wozniak in his parents' garage. Their first major success, the Apple II, ignited the personal computer revolution. In 1984, Jobs launched the Macintosh, introducing the graphical user interface (GUI) to the masses. However, internal power struggles led to his ouster from Apple in 1985.

During his "wilderness years," Jobs founded NeXT, a high-end computer company, and purchased The Graphics Group, which became Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar redefined animation with *Toy Story* (1995), making Jobs a billionaire.

In 1996, Apple, struggling and near bankruptcy, acquired NeXT to use its operating system, bringing Jobs back. He quickly became interim CEO, slashing projects and focusing on industrial design. This commenced one of the greatest corporate turnarounds in history. Under his leadership, Apple launched a series of iconic products: the iMac (1998), iPod (2001), iPhone (2007), and iPad (2010). He also established the Apple Store and iTunes, fundamentally changing how consumers bought technology and media.

Jobs was known for his "reality distortion field"—a mix of charisma, marketing genius, and demanding leadership style. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and, after a long battle, resigned as CEO in August 2011, passing away weeks later. His legacy remains defined by his obsession with merging the humanities with technology to create products that were intuitive, beautiful, and functional.
